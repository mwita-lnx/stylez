TechStack:
Python - Backend Development Django - Web Framework
PostgreSQL - Database Management
HTML, CSS, JavaScript(React) - Frontend Development
Tanda Africa's Payments API - Payment Transactions
Reasoning:
Python is a popular language for web development and is known for its scalability, flexibility, and
efficiency. Django is a widely used web framework for Python that provides a high-level
abstraction of the database, making it easier to work with. PostgreSQL is a robust, open-source
relational database management system that provides a high level of data integrity and security.
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend development allows for a dynamic, responsive,
and visually appealing user interface. Tanda Africa's Payments API is a secure and efficient
payment system that can handle transactions seamlessly. By combining these technologies, we
can create a robust and efficient platform that meets the project objectives and user
requirements.

For the MVP, the database should be able to store the following:

Vendor Information: Name, location, description, contact details, 
product categories, commission rate, and other relevant details.

Product Information: Name, description, price, vendor information,
 category, subcategory, images, and other relevant details.

Customer Information: Name, location, email address, contact details,
 and other relevant details.

Order Information: Order number, customer information, product information, 
delivery address, payment details, order status, and other relevant details.

Sales and Revenue Data: Total sales, commission earned, revenue generated,
 vendor payouts, and other relevant details.

User Data: User information, login credentials, preferences, and other relevant details.

Marketing Data: Data on user acquisition, user engagement, customer feedback
, and other relevant metrics.

These data points will allow the MVP to provide basic functionality to vendors and customers, while also enabling the platform to collect valuable data that can be used to improve the platform over time.
